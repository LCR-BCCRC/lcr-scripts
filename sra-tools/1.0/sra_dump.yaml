# This pipeline downloads data from SRA, including dbGaP access controlled data. 
# It is set up to prefetch the files rather than pulling them directly with sam-dump or fasterq-dump 
# because it is faster, more reliable, and restartable if the download gets interrupted. 
# It is highly recommended to extract the prefetched files to fastq and align them yourself if possible, 
# since fasterq-dump is multi-threaded and many times faster than sam-dump. 

out_file_type: "__UPDATE__" # options: fastq, bam or cram. Only use bam or cram if the SRA data are already in an aligned format.
accessions: "__UPDATE__" # file containing all SRA accession numbers for files to be downloaded. Must have one entry per line, no column names.

params:
  ngc: "/projects/rmorin/data/dbGaP/prj_24603.ngc" # ngc file; required for dbGaP restricted access projects. Default gives access to all of Ryan's projects. Leave blank for unrestricted repositories.
  ref: "__UPDATE__" # Reference genome fasta. Required if in_file_type is sam and out_file_type is cram.
  prefetch: "" # Additional arguments for `prefetch`. See `prefetch --help` for more details.
  sam-dump: "-u -r" # Additional sam-dump options. See `sam-dump --help` for more details. Default -r recreates sam header; -u includes unaligned reads.
  fastq_dump: "-3" # Additional fasterq-dump options. See `fasterq-dump --help` for more details. Default -3 splits fastq by read for paired end data; this Snakefile is incompatible with single-end data.
  samtools: "" # Additional samtools view options. See `samtools view --help` for more details.
